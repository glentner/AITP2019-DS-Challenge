# Hello!
We started out by looking at Stage 5 and determining what values for Indiana''s data we 
needed. We used a grep command in code/question1.txt to determine the first data
point recorded in Indiana.

Then we realized that missing IDs were represented by 999999. We sorted out every 
unique id with grep, cut, sort, uniq, and tr commands.
